# Google Sheets Mining Tracker for NiceHash
This repository is used to track all updates to my Publicly Shared Google Sheet for tracking Nicehash Mining Payments.

![Spreadsheet Dashboard](preview.png)

## How to Setup
Make a copy of any version of the spreadsheet, then go to the settings tab and fill out everything. It might take a moment to load everything in, if the dashboard does not look correct after a few moments, switch workbooks, then come back to the dashboard.

## Post-setup
Now you should have a google spreadsheet setup with all your data, if you need to refresh it there should be a menu option **External Resources -> Refresh**. You can also setup a trigger to run the **triggerAutoRefresh()** function every hour.
